# PHP Playground

This is a self-learning PHP repository. I use this repo to practice PHP and as
a reference for future PHP projects.

## Setup

These are optional settings. For learning purposes and easier investigation of
sessions and uploaded files, try adding these custom configurations to your
`php.ini`.

You will need to create a new directory called `Server` to contain
subdirectories, such as `sessions` and `uploads`.

```php
session.save_path=/<path>/Server/sessions
upload_tmp_dir=/<path>/Server/uploads
```
