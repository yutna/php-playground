xmlrpc-epi-php

This library is a PHP C extension that utilizes xmlrpc-epi to provide
a high performance, easy to use, php native interface to xmlrpc. It also
provides experimental support for SOAP v 1.1.

Key benefits of using this extension as compared to other php xmlrpc 
solutions are:

1) speed.  

Because it is in C, it is faster than implementations written in php.

2) ease of use. 

All data is sent/received as native php types, so there is no complicated 
new API to learn when dealing with data types.

3) escaping and encoding support.  

four different types of xml character escaping are available, which means you can
safely send any sort of data, even non-printable and "illegal" xml characters.
all encodings supported by your operating system are useable.

4) pretty printing

xml may be printed in 3 different ways to optimize for bandwidth efficiency or
human readability.

5) RPC Protocol Independence

The library currently speaks XML-RPC and a simpler non-standard protocol. 
New! There is also experimental support for SOAP 1.1.  All of these are 
accessed via the same application API.
 

This library has been demonstrated fully compliant with the XMLRPC spec,
having passed the test suite at http://validator.xmlrpc.com.

Various iterations of this code have been/are running at 
Epinions.com and are sufficiently fast for the high traffic volume this 
site encounters, with several xmlrpc type requests generated for each user 
http request.  No specific speed claims are made.  Your mileage may vary.

Sample php scripts are in ./sample.  The best/quickest way to learn
how to use the library is just to view the source to these and load 
them in your browser

It is the author's hope that this code will be found useful by someone, 
and would like to hear about how and where it is being used, or 
suggestions for improvement.
