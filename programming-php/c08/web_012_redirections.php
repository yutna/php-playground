// To send the browser to a new URL, known as a redirection, you set the
// `Location` header.
// Generally, you'll also exit immediately afterward, so the script does NOT
// bother generating and outputting the remainder of the code listing:

// header('Location: http://www.example.com/elsewhere.html');
// exit();

// When you provide a partial URL (e.g. /elsewhere.html), the web server handles
// this redirection internally.

// In general, you'll want to redirect to an absolute URL.
